Let’s perform another update, and deploy image tagged as `v10` :

`kubectl set image deployments/kubernetes-bootcamp kubernetes-bootcamp=gcr.io/google-samples/kubernetes-bootcamp:v10`{{execute}}

Use `get deployments` to see the status of the deployment:

`kubectl get deployments`{{execute}}

And something is wrong… We do not have the desired number of Pods available.
List the Pods again:

`kubectl get pods`{{execute}}

A `describe` command on the Pods should give more insights:

`kubectl describe pods`{{execute}}

There is no image called `v10` in the repository. Let’s roll back to our previously working version. We’ll use the `rollout` undo command:

`kubectl rollout undo deployments/kubernetes-bootcamp`{{execute}}

The `rollout` command reverted the deployment to the previous known state (v2 of the image). Updates are versioned and you can revert to any previously know state of a Deployment. List again the Pods:

`kubectl get pods`{{execute}}

Four Pods are running. Check again the image deployed on the them:

`kubectl describe pods`{{execute}}

We see that the deployment is using a stable version of the app (v1). The Rollback was successful.
