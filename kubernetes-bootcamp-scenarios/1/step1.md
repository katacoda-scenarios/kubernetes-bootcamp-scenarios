We already installed minikube for you. Check that it is properly installed, by running the *minikube version* command:

`minikube version`{{execute}}

OK, we can see that minikube is in place.

Start the cluster, by running the *minikube start* command:

`minikube start`{{execute}}

Great! You now have a running Kubernetes cluster in your online terminal. Minikube started a virtual machine for you, and a Kubernetes cluster is now running in that VM.
